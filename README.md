# Code to scrape birthdays of friends from Facebook

Random Project for testing automation and scraping skills using undetected_chromedriver (Selenium) and BeautifulSoup. 

Note: Some work to be done as facebook rate limits the number of requests per day. 
- Functions are implemented and tested to work on all profiles. 

Extraction of profile url for each friend is successfully implemented and tested upto 1800 profiles. Facebook starts to block requests when opening each profile so the maximum number of birthdays scraped at once is 80 for now. Will test more combinations of waiting times.
